Operators:-

-> Operators are a pre-defined symbol which is used to perform some task or an operation.
-> There are some special symbols in java which is used to perform some operations.
-> In operators we have operands. Based on the number of operands we have 3 types of operators.
   A.) Unary Operator
   B.) Binary Operator
   C.) Ternary Operator

 A.) Unary Operator:-
 -> Which accepts exactly one operand.

 B.) Binary Operator:-
 -> Which accepts exactly two operands.

 C.) Ternary Operator:-
 -> Which accepts more than two operands.

-> Classification Of Operators:-
  1.) Arithmetic Operator
  2.) Assignment Operator
  3.) Relational Operator
  4.) Logical Operator
  5.) Increment/Decrement Operator
  6.) Conditional Operator
  7.) Bitwise Operator
  8.) Miscellaneous Operator


 1.) Arithmetic Operator:-
 -> Arithmetic Operator are used to perform some Mathematical Arithmetic operations.
 -> The pre-defined symbols used in Arithmetic Operator are given below:-
      
       + -> Addition
       - -> Subtraction
       / -> Division( Quotient )
       * -> Multiplication
       % -> Modulus(Remainder)

 2.) Assignment Operator:-
 -> Assignment Operator are mainly used to assign values to a variable.
 -> Assignment Operator are used to reduce the line of an expression.
 -> Ex:-  int a=45; // the value of a is assigned with 45.

 -> There are some symbols which reduces the expression size. These symbols are given below:-
       += 
       -=
       /=
       *=
       %=

 Ex:-  int a=4;
       int b=5;
       a+=b; // can also be written as a=a+b;
       a-=b; // can also be written as a=a-b;


 3.) Relational Operator:-
 -> Relational Operators are used to check the relation between operands.
 -> The output or result of relational operator are always in Boolean format.
 -> The pre-defined symbols used for relational operators are given below:-
     < -> Lesser
     > -> Greater
     <= -> Lesser than or equals to
     >= -> Greater than or equals to
     == -> Equals to (Comparison Operator )
     != -> NotEquals to

 4.) Logical Operator:-
 -> Logical Operator are mainly used for performing logical operations for solving complex
    operations.
 -> The pre-defined symbols are used for logical operators are:-
     
      && -> Logical AND

      || -> Logical OR

       ! -> Logical NOT

   a.) Logical AND( && ):-
   -> If all the expressions are true, then Logical AND operator returns true or else returns
      false.
   -> Below is the Truth Table of Logical AND:-
  
      operand1   operand2  Logical AND(&&)
   
        T	   T            T
        T 	   F  	  	F
        F 	   T	        F
        F	   F	        F

   b.) Logical OR( || )
   -> If any one of the expression is true, then Logical OR operator returns true or else false.
   -> Below is the Truth Table of Logical OR:-
   
      operand1   operand2  Logical OR( || )
        T	   T	       T
        T	   F	       T
        F	   T	       T
        F	   F	       F

   c.) Not Operator( ! )
   -> Not operator flips the bits. It returns the inverse.
   -> Below is the Truth Table of NOT Operator:-

      operand     NOT( ! )
        T	   F   
        F	   T



 5.) Increment/Decrement Operator:-
 -> In java Increment means increases the value by 1. Decrement means decrease the value by 1.
 -> The pre-defined symbol used for increment operator is +
    The pre-defined symbol used for decrement operator is -
 
 -> In java Increment operator are of two types:-
       a.) Post Increment
       b.) Pre Increment

       a.) Post Decrement
       b.) Pre Decrement

  a.) POST Increment and PRE Increment:-
  -> If the ++ symbol is after the variable name then it is POST Increment.
     Syntax:-
     variableName++;  Ex:-  a++;
  
  -> If the -- symbol is before the variable name then it is PRE Increment.
     Syntax:-
     ++variableName; Ex:-   ++a;

 

  b.) POST Decrement and PRE Decrement:-
  -> If the -- symbol is after the variable name then it is POST Decrement.
     Syntax:-
     variableName--;  Ex:- a--;
  
  -> If the -- symbol is before the variable name then it is PRE Decrement.
     Syntax:-
     --variableName;  Ex:- --a;

 
    Ex1:-  int a=4;
           a++;
           System.out.println(a);// 5

    Ex2:-  int b=10;
           b++;
           System.out.println(b);// 11

  
 -> If we observe the above examples, both post and pre are giving the same values.
    We should follow some rules of POST and PRE if:-
         1.) We assign with the same variable name
         2.) Pass the expression inside print or println statement.

   RULES OF POST:-
    1.) Use the value, increase/decrease the value by 1 and update in memory
    2.) Use the substituted value
  
   RULES OF PRE:-
    1.) Use the value, increase/decrease the value by 1 and update in memory
    2.) Use the incremented/decremented value


  Ex1:-  int a=5;
         a=a++ + a; // should follow rules of POST since it is assigned to a variable name a //

  Ex2:-  int b=5;
         b++;  // NOT FOLLOW ANY RULES OF POST OR PRE //



 6.) Conditional Operator:-
 -> Conditional Operator are used to check the conditions between operands.
 -> The conditional operator are used to perform condition based using some pre-defined symbols.
 -> Syntax:-
    (Condition) ? "Statment1" : "Statment2";

 -> Condition is always in Boolean format.
 -> Working:-
    -> If the condition is true, the statement1 will be executed.
    -> If the condition is false, the statement2 will be executed.
 -> We can have n number of conditions but must be passed if the condition is false.
